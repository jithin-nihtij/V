Git is a version control system .



1.  init : Initializes empty Git repository in the folder
                creates a hidden .git file

2. add : to move changes from working directory to git

3. commit : it takes a snapshot and commits it to the repository

4.  log : it shows the commits we have done and information about it

5. HEAD : represents the latest commit

6. git reset : Reseting helps to completely remove changes that have not been pushed

7. branch :used to create branch  and to view the current branch that we are using.

8. merge : used to copy feature of one branch to another branch.

9. conflict : Conflict occurs when two branches have made edits to the same line in a file 
                or a file has been deleted in a branch and edited on the other

10. cherry-pick : to pick a specific commit from a branch and copy to another branch

11. diff : shows what changes are done on which lines before commit.

12. checkout : eg: git checkout HEAD~1 or 
                this will switch the commit from HEAD to HEAD - 1
                or 
                git checkout "commit-id"
                this will switch the commit to the specified commit id

13. clone : clone is used to collaborate, to share our repository with the collaborators

14. push : to upload the local repository to remote repository.

15. pull : pull is used to download content from a remote repository to local repository 

16. restore: for removing the modifications done before the next commit we can use

        1. git reset --hard 
        2. git chekout HEAD -f
        3. git checkout index.html (to restore a specific file) 

17. git branch newBranch : creates a branch called newBranch

18. git checkout newBranch : switches to newBranch

19.git merge newBranch : to merge newBranch to master branch

                            while merging conflict might occur we have to fix it manualy by using add ad commit

20. fetch : to track the changes in server from client

21. fetch and merge together is called pull


GitHub
______


GitHub is a cloud service for version control where  we can create a repository and  add and manage our code.

It can be used for collaboration.


how to push our folders to GitHub:

    git init

    git add .

    git commit -m "first commit"

    git branch -M master

    git remote add origin "repository-link"

    git push -u origin master


pull request : we can send a pull request to the server for pulling our branch into their main branch

* rebase : helps in having linear history

git pull --rebase
